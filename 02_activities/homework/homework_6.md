**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

I work in a garment manufacturing company and deal with manufacturing data. I've been analyzing the individual steps involved in making a garment, including the time it takes to complete each step and the labor cost associated with them. I've noticed that our database had quite a few blank fields about our operators, such as their birthdays, ages, and genders. It turns out that this data exists but is stored in our HR database and not transferred to our manufacturing database. While I initially thought this was due to inefficient data syncing, I now realize that it might be a deliberate decision to avoid using this data to filter, categorize, and analyze in ways that could potentially lead to discrimination.


By limiting our data to information strictly relevant to our manufacturing processes, we can minimize the risk of biased decision-making. While collecting attributes like age, gender, or other personal information may seem necessary in some contexts, having this data available for processing can still lead to discriminatory outcomes. By avoiding the collection of unnecessary personal data, we can ensure a more equitable and fair workplace.



This experience definitely influences my approach to database design in the future. It's important to remember that just because we can collect data doesn't mean we should. There is no such thing as "basic" data that we should collect regardless, especially if it's personal information.
